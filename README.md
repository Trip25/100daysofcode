# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary

## Day 1

Monday 6th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

- I learnt a new mark-up language called Markdown 
- Sorting out my GitHub repos ready for the bootcamp.
- I used markdown to create README docs for this diary.
- On Codecademy learning links and buttons.
- On FreeCodeCamp, did a few tasks for the <italics>"Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet"</italics>

### Thoughts:

I'm feeling really excited to have started 100 Days Of Code and already feel more motivated to code every day. I think having a goal of just one hour a day seems very manageable for me, rather than feeling like unless I spend at least 3 hours a day learning it's not worth it.

## Day 2

Tuesday 7th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

- On Codecademy learning links and buttons.
- On FreeCodeCamp, did a few tasks for the <italics>"Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet"</italics>
- Watched the Binance Charity x School Of Code Virtual event to hear about the training programme and previous alumni.
- Did a mini project on how to code a wavey text animation after seeing a video on tiktok.

### Thoughts:
Relaxed in the morning and saw the Binance x School of Code collaboration after being shared on Slack and decided to watch the virtual event to find out more about the School of Code programme and how alumni found it and how they ended up in their current job. Sounds like although the programme is intense and challenging, it's a great way to learn and gain skills to continue learning and highly rewarding. Very excited to start the course now!

### Thoughts:
Continued freecodecamp and codecademy, typing with frozen fingers as it snowed in March! Met the other bootcampers in the SOC pre-course social event wehere we had multiple rounds on films, science, geography and diltoids. Everyone seems lovely and will need to get enough rest for Monday! Also going through the Git learning website linked below, shared by another bootcamper, just to jog my memory.
