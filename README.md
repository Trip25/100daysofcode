# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary

## Day 1

Monday 6th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

- I learnt a new mark-up language called Markdown 
- Sorting out my GitHub repos ready for the bootcamp.
- I used markdown to create README docs for this diary.
- On Codecademy learning links and buttons.
- On FreeCodeCamp, did a few tasks for the <italics>"Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet"</italics>

### Thoughts:

I'm feeling really excited to have started 100 Days Of Code and already feel more motivated to code every day. I think having a goal of just one hour a day seems very manageable for me, rather than feeling like unless I spend at least 3 hours a day learning it's not worth it.

## Day 2

Tuesday 7th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

- On Codecademy learning links and buttons.
- On FreeCodeCamp, did a few tasks for the <italics>"Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet"</italics>
- Watched the Binance Charity x School Of Code Virtual event to hear about the training programme and previous alumni.
- Did a mini project on how to code a wavey text animation after seeing a video on tiktok.

### Thoughts:
Relaxed in the morning and saw the Binance x School of Code collaboration after being shared on Slack and decided to watch the virtual event to find out more about the School of Code programme and how alumni found it and how they ended up in their current job. Sounds like although the programme is intense and challenging, it's a great way to learn and gain skills to continue learning and highly rewarding. Very excited to start the course now!

### **Today's progress**:
- Watched a video explaining the Internet of Things (IoT)
-Codecademy: read article on Affordances, Signifiers, and Clickability

### Thoughts:
Not much coding/learning for today as I spent time with my mum with personal chores and very tired from driving around all day. I did watch a video on the Internet of Things and read an article on Codecademy.

## Day 5

Friday 10th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Further reading on :
  - Signifiers, Not Affordances by Don Norman. This article discusses a bit of the history of thought around affordances and signifiers, and their importance in design.
  - UI Patterns.com has many examples of solutions to common design patterns in web design.
-Completed links and buttons on Codecademy and a project called Summit. Now moving onto "Learn Secondary Navigation" 

### Thoughts:
-Learning more about UI is quite interesting and will consider a deeper understanding of it once I'm more familiar with CSS.

## Day 7

Monday 13th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- First day of the School of Code programme, we had an intro to the programme by the founder and also had some ice breaker sessions in between. We went through Computational Thinking and also a guide to Thinking.
- Pair programming practice with CSS Diner and getting used to sharing our screen. Ironed out any technical issues.
- Discussed how to solve problems in our breakout rooms.
    1. Understand the problem
    2. Break down the problem
    3. Look for patterns
    4. Model the real world
    5. Write an algorithm
- Waterfall vs Agile

### Thoughts:
- Prediction: I will be very tired by the end of the day xD This was true, very interesting and learning to get into the mindset of being comfortable of being comfortable and not to be afraid to ask questions as everyone is in the same boat, with the same goal! 
- I enjoyed the CSS diner as it was a nice visual way to see the question and hoe to figure out the answer. Whilst also getting to grips with pair programming, one person being the driver while the other is the navigator.

 ## Day 8

Tuesday 14th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
-Collaborative puzzles
-Flowchart to plan our graduation 4 months away!
-Login and higher/lower quiz made in Scratch
-Using Git commands in the terminal for the Romeo and Juli-git, adding lines, git pushing/pulling.

### Thoughts:
Got put in our first SOC coding pair with Tristan and Umamah, so spent the day in and out of breakrooms with them, working on some space puzzles. It was a fun and interesting learning to communicate and collaborate on tasks, specifically the space puzzles where we were initially stumped but somehow kept going to find the answer!

 ## Day 9

Wednesday 15th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
-Introduction to JavaScript- Workshop 101 and 102

### Thoughts:
Found JavaScript to be quite interesting but when it came to doing the tasks, our team would get muddled a bit. So I think I will look over some resources from freecodecamp and Microsoft to see if I can get to better grips of it. Also had to work on pushing to github after class as it wasn't working well on my pc, but managed to fix it using my mac instead.

 ## Day 10

Thursday 16th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Morning Mindful sessions: Feedback
- JavaScript: Objects, Lists, Arrays, If/Else, While loops

### Thoughts:
From yesterdays fiasco with trying to push back into the exercise from the gtihub classrooms, today seemed to go a lot more smoother. I've grasped the JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Hopefully it goes even smoother tomorrow for our first hack-a-thon!

 ## Day 11

Friday 17th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
-Hackathon: Making a game of Rock, Paper & Scissors using JavScript!

### Thoughts:
I am exhausted brb <br>
Ok I put some eyedrops in and had a nap, started off in the morning with a re-cap of the weeks topics.
Then from just before lunch to around quarter past four we worked on the tasks of the below github class. It was quite challenging and at parts we were quite mystified on why it didn't work and did work! <br> 
I found it very interesting seeing how other people tackled the code and learnt not to be afraid of messing around and trying different things to see if it works. It was also nice feeding back to other groups in a small setting to see how others found it! All in all a challenging and exciting day! That's the first week done.

 ## Day 13

Sunday 19th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

-Attempted the w3Schools JavaScript test to see how much I know [22/25 = 88% TimeSpent 4:09]

### Thoughts:
I feel better having looked back at the topics I have learnt over the week. But definitely feel I still need to practice practice practice writing the code. And to understand what the questions are asking of me,because I know I try to over complicate things by over thinking!

 ## Day 14
Monday 20th March 2023
### **Today's progress**:
- Met up with my industry mentor
-Recap Quiz [ 19/20 ]
-Giving feedback
-Code Wars with new pairs
-HTML Document Object Model Workshops
### Thoughts:
It was nice to give feedback to the pair I was working with last week and nice to meet the new pair this week! 
I think using pair programming has definitely helped break down the problems and also to see how others tackle/ interpret the task question. Definitely feel like last week's lessons have cemented more in my brain and very excited to finally use JavaScript change the webpage slowly!

 ## Day 15

 Tuesday 21st March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Recap Quiz (Full marks!!)
- Started off with CodeWars exercises
- Talk from Alumni 
- Learnt about Events
- Worked on the Events workshop
- Worked on a individual workshop RPS DOM

### Thoughts:
Felt half like I knew DOM elements and Events and how to link them but also felt lost at times when trying to actually execute the task. I will need to revise more on this topic and maybe also watch tutorials as well as asking ChatGPT and using Github copilot for explanations and planning properly!
I did have a go after class (after a much needed dinner!) to look through the RPS files and see why the events were not working properly and managed to work it how somehow. Also added a box shadow and some colour but kept it pretty simple for now. I do plan on re-visiting another time to add images.

 ## Day 16

 Wednesday 22nd March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Recap Quiz
- CodeWars
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- API (Application Programming Interface)

### Thoughts:
So today we learnt about Asynchronous Javascript and had to work on getting the clock hands to move, which was a struggle ngl. Afterwards we learnt about API and made a webpage which uses a cat fact API, very interesting and I will definitely have a go with other public APIs.

 ## Day 17

 Thursday 23rd March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- CodeWars Challenges
- Mindset Sessions: Working with different personalities
- UI Guest Talk: Paavan Buddhder
- Team Research: Deeper dive into obscure html tags
- Kumospace- Talk on how to use notion for studying/progress

### Thoughts:
A nice change of pace today as I had time to slow down and calm down(although probably eye of the storm for tomorrow's hackathon!)Learn about cognitive diversity, we tookt he Myers Briggs Test before to find out all our different personality types and how to work effectviely as a team adn also if we were managers. Very interested in learning more about the UI/UX side, which we are apparently going to be learning next week, which is exciting. Ended of the afternoon with a group research task where we were all given different topics to research and later present. We recorded via zoom and uploaded to YT(unlisted), so the class will be able to access it later and hopefully learn. Was also nice to talk to more people outside of our pairs and how they found the course. Also got introduced to Exercism which is similar to Codewars and hopefulyl another resource to practice and improve my technical skills.

 ## Day 18

 Friday 24th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
Hackathon- Feth API

### Thoughts:
This time round the hackathon was very enjoyable, it was great to discuss and be creative with our ideas. We chose the Pokemon API which seemed fun at first but there was a vast amount of data which we had to work out how to manipulate to reflect well on our website. It was also nice to be able to see other peoples projects and present our own in a smaller group.

 ## Day 21

 Monday 27th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Started off with a guest speaker who was a School of Code Cohort 2 Alumni and told us about his career and is now in SRE which is Site Reliability Engineer which was a very interesting insight as he did hop into a lot of varied positions. 
We also started UI/UX design and focused on CSS Flex Design and CSS Grid.

### Thoughts:
We tried to re-create the Google website, with just the HTML file and I can see I still have a lot of work to do!

### **Today's progress**:
Recap Quix on Agile methodology and CSS Design.Today learnt about Design Thinking and designing user profiles, user flowcharts and the five stages of Design: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test. It's very interesting and I'm considering this as one of the pathways to get a job in. Also tried (paper)prototyping without the paper.

 ## Day 26

Saturday 1st April 2023

### **Today's progress**:
Catching up with what I missed on yesterday's hackathon and slowly going through the recap task which is to start making a website about ME.
Git cloned the recap task and used Figma to map out the user profiles of who would be accessing my website and also to make a near high fidelity prototype. Next I started on making my website although I was a bit back and forth on choosing which colour themes to use! So I added the colours I liked into comments so I could experiment! Very fun once I got going but as I'm still recovering from a super bad flu (luckily tested negative for Covid), I need to carry on resting. 
<br>
Also downloaded Node.js to ready for next week, let's go week 4.

### **Today's progress**:
- CodeWars challenges
- Recap Quiz: BC14 - W4D3- Intro to testing [7/8]
- Recap over unit tests with Jest
- New content: End to End Testing with Playwright
- Workshop

### Thoughts:
Unit testing seemed simple but when we had to start writing more tests using Playwright for a To Do application, it began to get a lot more difficult. Especially when you have to target the right DOM elements.. 
Definitely need a lot more practice to get my head around it.

 ## Day 32

Friday 7th April 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Bank Holiday today so was able to sleep in and recover from my cold a bit more!
- Once I've had my coffee and went for a walk to wake up, I was able to start on my recap task. The first being "make your own CodeWars kata". This took me a couple hours, initally planning a question and then setting the test up, which did take a couple attempts.. 
- But once I got my first green tick from the test, it went quite smooth for the rest of the tests and I forkered it to my personal github account.
- After that had to go pick up mum from work so stopped before I installed the Playwright testing which I will have  ago at tomorrow!

**-Breakout activity 1**

```jsx
// Import the express module. This module is a framework that provides a set of
// features for web and mobile applications.
import express from "express";

// Initialize an instance of express and store it in the app variable.
const app = express();

// Define a variable to store the port number that your server will listen on.
const port = 3000;

// Define a route handler for GET requests made to the root path ("/").
// When a client makes a GET request to the root path, this function is called.
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // The function takes two arguments: req and res.
  // req (short for "request") is an object containing information about the
  // client's request, such as the request path, the HTTP method, and the headers.
  // res (short for "response") is an object used to send a response back to the client.

  // Use the res.send() function to send a string as a response. This string will be
  // displayed in the client's browser or returned to the client's HTTP client.
  res.send("Hello Bootcampers!");
});

// Tell your express app to start listening for incoming HTTP requests on the given port.
// The second argument is a callback function that's called when the server successfully
// starts listening.
app.listen(port, () => {
  // Use console.log() to print a message to the console. This is useful for letting
  // you know that the server has successfully started and is ready to accept requests.
  console.log(`Server is up and running on port: ${port}`);
});
```

Example code from session exploring ways of using express to:

- create route handlers
- listen on a port
- parse request paths
- parse HTTP Methods
- parse Query Strings
- parse a JSON Body
- Send a TEXT response
- Send a JSON response

```
import express from "express";

const app = express();

const port = 3000;

// Tell express to parse JSON body
app.use(express.json());

// Get methods
// JSON response and status code example
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.status(418).json({
    msg:"Hello Bootcampers!"
  });
});

// Example url parameter
app.get("/quotes/:id", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params);
  res.send(`The quote you requested has an id of ${req.params.id}`);
})

// Query string example
app.get("/sami", function(req, res) {
  console.log(req.query);
  if (req.query.dog === "true") {
    return res.send("DOG");
  }
  res.send("Yo, whatups!");
})

// POST method
// Parsing request body example
app.post("/contact-form", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send("IT worked! (POST)");
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is up and running on port: ${port}`);
})

**15:07 Workshop: Building a REST API**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## Day 66

Thursday 11th May 2023

### **Today's progress**:
- Codewars
- Quiz W9D3- Express and Web fundamentals [9/10]
- 10:23 Express 
- Custom MIDDLEWARE
- Express.Static 
- 11:32 Guest talk: Talis Elly Durrant & Nadeem Shabir <strong>Intro to RESTful API’s</strong>
- Go through express.static, make a POST request and what to do on the ThunderClient side
- Third-party middleware: Morgan.js, applying to certain routes
- Breakout room Activity:
You'll be working with the Quotes API that we built in yesterday's workshop. Here are the tasks I'd like you to complete:

1. **Implement a Custom Middleware Function:** Middleware functions are a powerful feature of Express.js. They can perform various tasks, like error handling, logging, or even modifying the request or response objects. I'd like you to implement a custom middleware function in your Quotes API. This could be anything you like. For example, you could create a middleware that logs the time of each request, or one that checks if the request has a specific header. Feel free to get creative!
2. **Serve a Static File from a Public Folder:** As part of building a full-fledged web server, you need to be able to serve static files. For this task, please serve an image file from a public folder in your project. This image could be anything - a logo, a background image, or a placeholder image.
3. **Use Morgan Middleware:** Morgan is a popular middleware package for logging HTTP requests. Implement Morgan in your API to gain visibility into incoming requests. This can be incredibly useful for debugging and understanding how your API is used.
4. **Ensure Your API Follows REST Guidelines:** Building on our guest talk on REST, I'd like you to delve deeper into REST principles and ensure your API follows these guidelines. This includes using proper HTTP methods, structuring your endpoints correctly, and appropriately using status codes. Don't worry if you don't get everything right at first. The goal here is to learn and improve, so take it step by step.
  
### Thoughts:
Tip: Try to console.log() everything, check what's in the request, response and have a better understanding for debugging.

 ## Day 67

Friday 12th May 2023

### **Today's progress**:
Hackathon - Build a Back End
- CRUD Routes
- Test with Thunder Client or Postman (need to research into this more)

### Thoughts:
Amazed at what we were able to achieve today, who would have thought we would have made our own REST API and also be able to get it functional and linked up to the front-end(which was given to use, but next week I'm sure we would have to make our own). We even managed to get into the bonus tasks by joining up the front end, adding some middleware and adding new features to the app.

 ## Day 70

Monday 15th May 2023

### **Today's progress**:
WEEK 10: DATABASES
Intro to SQL
11am start:
<strong>Persistent Storage with Databases</strong>

New pair- C 34: Danayet Gezaie and Lhizelle Tu
- Work on SQLBolt
- 14:30 Energiser: Scattergories
- 15:00-16:45 SQL Murder Mystery

### Thoughts:
Databases are for more robust solutions, for retrieving large amounts of data. Enable us to **CRUD**

**Create**

**Read**

**Update**

**Delete**

Types of Databases

Non-relational

**Relational database: SQL, table based

We will be learning POSTgres over the next couple of days. Columns contain attributes or types of data. Each row represents a individual record or data point with its own unique id known as a Primary Key.

**SQL: Structured Query Lanaguage**

***SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE***

Here are the extension tasks for today. You can tackle these now or after you complete this morning's exercises. The choice is yours.
15:11
<strong>Task 1 - Creating an ERD using Lucidchart</strong>
Objective: Gain hands-on experience with designing database structures using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
1.  Create a Lucidchart account
  - Go to Lucidchart's website and sign up for a free account if you don't already have one.
2.  Start a new ERD
  - Once you're logged in, click on "+ New" and select "Blank Document" to start designing your ERD.
3.  Design your ERD
  - This is where your creativity comes into play. You get to decide what kind of database you want to design. It could be anything from a bookstore, a zoo, a school, or even a fictional universe!
  - Drag and drop shapes from the toolbox to represent tables. Label them with relevant table names such as 'Customers,' 'Orders,' 'Animals,' 'Species,' 'Students,' 'Courses,' etc., based on the database you've chosen.
  - Inside each table shape, add your fields (like 'Customer ID,' 'Order ID,' etc.). Remember to mark the primary keys.
  - Now think about how these tables relate to each other. Is it a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship? Draw lines between the tables to represent these relationships.
4.  Review and Save
  - Take a moment to review your ERD. Does it accurately represent the data and its relationships?
  - Once you're happy with it, save your work.

<strong>Task 2 - Creating and Interacting with a Database using DB Fiddle</strong>
Objective: Develop practical skills in implementing a database from an ERD and performing CRUD operations.
1.  Open DB Fiddle
  - Go to the DB Fiddle website. Make sure you select PostgreSQL 15 as the database version.
2.  Create your Tables
  - Refer back to your ERD from the first task. Now you're going to create these tables in DB Fiddle. Write your SQL CREATE TABLE commands in the schema panel.
3.  Insert Data
  - Once your tables are set up, it's time to populate them with data. Write some SQL INSERT INTO commands to add records to your tables.
4.  Perform CRUD operations and more
  - Now that your database is populated, it's time to interact with it. Try out the following:
      - Create - Add more records to your tables using the INSERT INTO command.
      - Read - Retrieve data from your tables using the SELECT command. Try different WHERE conditions to filter your data.
      - Update - Change some of your existing records using the UPDATE command. Don't forget to use WHERE to specify which record(s) to update.
      - Delete - Remove some records from your tables using the DELETE command. Remember, use WHERE to specify the record(s) to delete.
  - Additionally, consider exploring:
      - Joining tables - Try to use different types of JOIN (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
      - Aggregating data - Use aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.) to compute a single output value from multiple input values.
      - Ordering and grouping - Experiment with the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses to organize your data.
5.  Reflect
  - Reflect on the process. How did your ERD help in creating the database? How comfortable are you with performing CRUD operations and more advanced SQL commands?

15:12 Remember, learning SQL and understanding database structures is like learning a new language. The more you practice, the more fluent you'll become!
