# 100 Days Of Code Diary / School of Code Bootcamp Diary

## Day 1

Monday 6th March 2023

### **Today's progress**:

- I learnt a new mark-up language called Markdown 
- Sorting out my GitHub repos ready for the bootcamp.
- I used markdown to create README docs for this diary.
- On Codecademy learning links and buttons.
- On FreeCodeCamp, did a few tasks for the "Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building A Balance Sheet"

### Thoughts:

I'm feeling really excited to have started 100 Days Of Code and already feel more motivated to code every day. I think having a goal of just one hour a day seems very manageable for me, rather than feeling like unless I spend at least 3 hours a day learning it's not worth it.
